/* INSTRUCTIONS:
 *   You are to write a RARS translation of this C program.  Because
 *   this is the first assembly language program you are writing where you
 *   must deal with register conflicts and manage the stack, there are
 *   a lot of hints given in C comments about how to do the translation.
 *   In future lab exercises and on midterms, you will be expected
 *   to do this kind of translation without being given very many hints!
 */

/* Hint: Function prototypes, such as the next two lines of C,
 * are used by a C compiler to do type checking and sometimes type
 * conversions in function calls.  They do NOT cause ANY assembly
 * language code to be generated.
